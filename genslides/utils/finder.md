### Function: `getFromTask`

#### Primary Features and Functionalities:
1. Extracting information from a task considering different criteria like message content, JSON data, tokens count, branch code, parameters, and code.
2. Dynamically replacing placeholders in a given text with actual values retrieved from a task's data.
3. Handling various data structures like dictionaries, lists, and nested JSON objects during information retrieval.
4. Addressing specific cases like JSON lists and recursive parent tasks while fetching data.

#### Example 1: Retrieving Message Content
```python
def getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager):
    if arr[1] == 'msg_content':
        text_to_replace = rep_text.replace(res, task.getLastMsgContent())
    return text_to_replace

# Usage
task = TaskObject()
manager = TaskManager()
arr = ['placeholder', 'msg_content']
res = '[[placeholder:msg_content]]'
rep_text = 'This is a placeholder message: [[placeholder:msg_content]]'
result = getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager)
print(result)
```

**Expected Output:**  
`This is a placeholder message: Actual message content`

#### Example 2: Handling JSON Data
```python
def getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager):
    if arr[1] == 'json':
        param = task.getLastMsgContent()
        bres, jjson = Loader.Loader.loadJsonFromText(param)
        if bres:
            target_value = jjson[arr[3]]
            rep_text = rep_text.replace(res, json.dumps(target_value, indent=1))
    return rep_text

# Usage
task = TaskObject()
manager = TaskManager()
arr = ['placeholder', 'json', 'key_name']
res = '[[placeholder:json:key_name]]'
rep_text = 'This is a placeholder JSON value: [[placeholder:json:key_name]]'
result = getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager)
print(result)
```

**Expected Output:**  
`This is a placeholder JSON value: { "key_name": "value" }`

#### Example 3: Handling Parameters
```python
def getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager):
    if arr[1] == 'param' and len(arr) > 3:
        pres, pparam = task.getParamStruct(arr[2])
        if pres and arr[3] in pparam:
            value = pparam[arr[3]]
            if isinstance(value, str):
                rep_text = rep_text.replace(res, pparam[arr[3]])
            else:
                rep_text = rep_text.replace(res, str(pparam[arr[3]])
    return rep_text

# Usage
task = TaskObject()
manager = TaskManager()
arr = ['placeholder', 'param', 'param_name', 'key_name']
res = '[[placeholder:param:param_name:key_name]]'
rep_text = 'This is a placeholder param value: [[placeholder:param:param_name:key_name]]'
result = getFromTask(arr, res, rep_text, task, manager)
print(result)
```

**Expected Output:**  
`This is a placeholder param value: Actual parameter value`

#### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure the correct task and manager objects are provided to the `getFromTask` function.
- Verify that the array `arr` contains the required information to fetch the desired data from the task.
- Check for any exceptions raised during JSON parsing or parameter retrieval.
