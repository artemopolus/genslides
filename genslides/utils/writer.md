Function: writeToFile

Primary features and functionalities:
1. Write text to a file at a specified path.
2. Create the necessary folders in the specified path if they do not exist.

Example 1: Writing text to a new file
```python
path = "output/files/sample.txt"
text = "Hello, World!"
writeToFile(path, text)
```
This example demonstrates how to create a new file "sample.txt" in the "output/files" directory and write the text "Hello, World!" to it.

Expected output:
A new file "sample.txt" with the content "Hello, World!" created in the specified directory.

Example 2: Appending text to an existing file
```python
path = "output/files/sample.txt"
text = "\nWelcome to the world of Python!"
writeToFile(path, text, 'a')
```
In this example, we append the text "Welcome to the world of Python!" to the existing "sample.txt" file.

Expected output:
The "sample.txt" file contains both "Hello, World!" and "Welcome to the world of Python!" texts.

Example 3: Writing text to a nested directory
```python
path = "output/nested/files/sample.txt"
text = "This file is in a nested directory."
writeToFile(path, text)
```
This example showcases writing text to a file in a nested directory structure. If the nested directories do not exist, they will be created.

Expected output:
A new file "sample.txt" with the content "This file is in a nested directory." created in the "output/nested/files" directory.

Note: Ensure proper file permissions and directory paths to avoid any issues with writing to files.
**Function Name: checkFolderPathAndCreate**

    # Create the necessary directories if they don't exist to avoid FileNotFoundError
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        lst_path = os.path.split(path)
        if not os.path.exists(lst_path[0]):
            Path(lst_path[0]).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        
    # Write the text content to the specified file
    with open(path, ctrl, encoding='utf8') as f:
        f.write(text)
```

Incorporating comments in the code allows for better understanding of the purpose behind specific code segments, aiding in code readability and maintenance.

These comments provide insights into the reasoning behind the code structure and help ensure that the code is more comprehensible for developers working with it.
##Recommendations for function
checkFolderPathAndCreate


In the updated `checkFolderPathAndCreate` function, the code is needed to ensure that a given folder path exists and create it if it does not. 

```python
from typing import NoReturn, Tuple

def checkFolderPathAndCreate(path: str) -> NoReturn:
    """
    Checks the existence of a folder path and creates it if it does not exist.

    Args:
        path (str): The path of the folder to be checked and created.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the path does not exist or is not accessible.
    """
    
    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    if not os.path.exists(path):  # Check if the path does not already exist
        lst_path: Tuple[str, str] = os.path.split(path)  # Split the path to check the parent directory
        if not os.path.exists(lst_path[0]):  # Check if the parent directory does not exist
            Path(lst_path[0]).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)  # Create the parent directory and any missing parent directories
```

The comments in the code explain the logic behind checking and creating the folder path. It clarifies that the function checks for the existence of the specified path and its parent directory before creating them if necessary. The comments help in understanding the purpose and flow of the code without delving into implementation details.
