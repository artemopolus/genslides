# Main part
# Examples

Unfortunately, I am unable to create a complete sample code for all the specifics you requested for the "ReadFileMan_class" without further details and the context of the actual implementation of the class within the larger codebase. 

However, I can provide you with examples of how to use the main functionalities of the `ReadFileMan` class based on the code provided earlier. Here are some simple usage examples:

1. Reading a file using the `readStandart` method:
```python
reader = ReadFileMan()
file_content = reader.readStandart('sample_file.txt')
print(file_content)
```

2. Reading a file with a custom header using the `readWithHeader` method:
```python
reader = ReadFileMan()
file_content_with_header = reader.readWithHeader('sample_file.txt', 'Header Here')
print(file_content_with_header)
```

3. Reading a specific portion of a file using the `readPartitial` method:
```python
reader = ReadFileMan()
success, partial_content = reader.readPartitial('sample_file.txt', 10)
if success:
    print(partial_content)
else:
    print("Error: " + partial_content)
```

These examples demonstrate how to read files using different methods of the `ReadFileMan` class. You can expand on these examples by incorporating more complex use cases and scenarios based on your specific requirements. Let me know if you need further assistance or modifications to these examples!
For the `readPartitial` function in the `ReadFileMan` class, here are some usage examples highlighting its features and functionalities:

### Example 1: Reading a Partial Section of a Text File
```python
s_path = "sample.txt"
s_start = 50

success, result = ReadFileMan.readPartitial(s_path, s_start)

if success:
    print(result)
else:
    print(result)
```

**Introduction:** This example demonstrates how to read and display a partial section of a text file using the `readPartitial` function.

**Expected Output:** If the file exists, it will display a part of the file starting from the 50th character. If the file does not exist, it will display an error message.

### Example 2: Handling Non-Text File Extension
```python
s_path = "sample.pdf"
s_start = 30

success, result = ReadFileMan.readPartitial(s_path, s_start)

if success:
    print(result)
else:
    print(result)
```

**Introduction:** This example showcases how the function handles files with extensions other than `.txt` or `.json`.

**Expected Output:** It will return an error message stating that the file exists but cannot be read due to the file type.

### Example 3: Reading a Large Section of a Text File
```python
s_path = "long_text.txt"
s_start = 100

success, result = ReadFileMan.readPartitial(s_path, s_start)

if success:
    print(result)
else:
    print(result)
```

**Introduction:** This example demonstrates reading and displaying a large section of a text file starting from the 100th character.

**Expected Output:** It will show a section of the file from the starting character until the ending character, based on the file's length.

By following these examples and adjusting the file paths and start positions as needed, users can effectively utilize the `readPartitial` function to read specific parts of text files.
The function `readStandart` in the provided Python code is responsible for reading the contents of a file specified by the given path. It opens the file in read mode and reads the entire content, returning it as a string. Below are examples demonstrating the usage of the `readStandart` function:

### Example 1: Reading a Text File
This example shows how to read the content of a text file using the `readStandart` function.

```python
file_path = "sample.txt"
content = ReadFileMan.readStandart(file_path)

print(content)
```

**Expected Output:**
The content of the text file "sample.txt" will be displayed on the console.

### Example 2: Reading a JSON File
Here's how you can read the content of a JSON file using the `readStandart` function.

```python
json_file_path = "data.json"
json_data = ReadFileMan.readStandart(json_file_path)

print(json_data)
```

**Expected Output:**
The JSON data from the file "data.json" will be printed on the screen.

### Example 3: Handling File Not Found Error
In case the specified file path is incorrect or the file does not exist, the function will raise a `FileNotFoundError`.

```python
invalid_path = "non_existent_file.txt"

try:
    content = ReadFileMan.readStandart(invalid_path)
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Expected Output:**
An error message indicating that the file was not found will be shown.

By using these example scenarios, users can understand how to utilize the `readStandart` function to read the contents of different types of files and handle potential errors that may arise during file reading operations.
For function `readWithHeader` in the Python file `readfileman.py`, we will demonstrate its primary features and functionalities through various examples. This function reads a file with a specified header and returns the contents of the file with the header at the beginning and end.

Below are examples showcasing the usage of the `readWithHeader` function:

### Simple Example: 
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `readWithHeader` function by providing a file path and a header string.

```python
file_path = "example.txt"
header = "File Content"
result = ReadFileMan.readWithHeader(file_path, header)
print(result)
```

#### Expected Output:
```
File Content
==========
[Contents of the file]
==========
```

### Advanced Example:
In this example, we will read a file, include a custom header, and handle a case where the file does not exist.

```python
file_path = "sample.txt"
header = "Read File"
result = ReadFileMan.readWithHeader(file_path, header)
if result:
    print(result)
else:
    print("File not found.")
```

#### Expected Output:
If the file exists:
```
Read File
==========
[Contents of the file]
==========
```
If the file does not exist:
```
File not found.
```

### Usage Notes:
- Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists before calling the `readWithHeader` function.
- The header string provided will be displayed at the beginning and end of the file contents.

By following the examples and instructions provided, users can effectively utilize the `readWithHeader` function in the `readfileman.py` Python file.
