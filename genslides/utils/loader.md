Class Overview:
The `Loader` class provides utilities for loading files, handling paths, converting strings to lists, and working with JSON data. Its core functionality includes converting strings to lists, loading JSON data from text, getting file and directory paths from the system, and performing path-related operations.

Constructor Parameters:
The `Loader` class does not have an explicit constructor method, so there are no parameters to document.

Public Attributes:
The `Loader` class does not have any public attributes.

Significant Public Methods:
1. `stringToList(text: str) -> list`: Converts a string with comma-separated values to a list.
2. `stringToPathList(text: str) -> bool, list`: Checks if paths in the input string exist and returns a boolean along with the list of paths.
3. `loadJsonFromText(text: str) -> bool, dict`: Loads JSON data from a text input and returns a boolean along with the parsed JSON object.
4. `getFilePathFromSystem(manager_path: str = '') -> str`: Opens a file dialog and returns the selected file path. It optionally checks for a manager path tag.
5. `getDirPathFromSystem(manager_path: str = '') -> str`: Opens a directory dialog and returns the selected directory path. It can also check for a manager path tag.
6. `getFolderPath(path: str) -> str`: Returns the parent folder path of a given file path.
7. `getUniPath(path: str) -> str`: Converts a path to a platform-independent format.

    """
    Parses a string representation of a list of paths and checks if the paths exist.

    Args:
        text (str): A string containing a list of paths.

    Returns:
        Tuple[bool, List[str]]: A tuple containing a boolean indicating if all paths exist 
                                and a list of paths.
    
    This function is needed to convert a string representation of paths into a list and validate their existence.

    The code below iterates over each path in the list and verifies if the path exists in the file system.
    If a path does not exist, the function returns False and the list of paths for further handling.

    The use of os.path.exists() ensures that the path check operation is platform-independent.

    Regular expressions are not used here to keep the code simple and efficient for this specific task.

    Comments and variable names are used to enhance code readability and maintainability.

---
The "Loader" class in the provided Python file contains various utility methods for loading files, paths, and JSON data. Here are the primary features and functionalities of the class:

1. Converting string to a list and vice versa.
2. Loading JSON data from text.
3. Getting file path and directory path from the system.
4. Handling file paths for both Windows and Unix systems.
5. Checking if a file path is within a specified manager path.

To demonstrate the usage of key functionalities, below are some example use cases:

### Example 1: Converting a string to a list

```python
# Convert a string to a list
text = "['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']"
file_list = Loader.stringToList(text)
print(file_list)
```

**Output**: `['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']`

### Example 2: Loading JSON data from text

```python
# Load JSON data from text
json_text = "{ 'key': 'value' }"
success, json_data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(json_text)
if success:
    print(json_data)
else:
    print("Failed to load JSON data")
```

**Output**: `{'key': 'value'}`

### Example 3: Getting file path from the system

```python
# Get file path from the system
file_path = Loader.getFilePathFromSystem()
print(file_path)
```

**Output**: Path to the selected file

These examples demonstrate basic operations of the Loader class. As you progress, more advanced features can be explored, such as handling paths in different operating systems and applying the methods in a real-world scenario to manage files efficiently.

Feel free to experiment with these examples and provide feedback on their clarity and usefulness. Further examples can be added or refined based on user input for better understanding and functionality.
**Function: checkManagerTag**

*Introduction:*

The `checkManagerTag` function in the provided Python code is designed to manipulate file paths based on the relationship with a specified manager path. This function checks if the file path is relative to the manager path and converts the file path accordingly. This is useful when handling paths within a specific directory structure.

*Key Features:*

1. Determine if a file path is relative to a specified manager path.
2. Convert the file path to a modified path based on the manager path.
3. Handle different operating systems for path manipulation.

*Example 1: Basic Usage*

In this example, we demonstrate the basic usage of the `checkManagerTag` function by providing a file path and a manager path. We then call the function to check and modify the file path if necessary.

```python
file_path = 'C:/users/documents/file.txt'
manager_path = 'C:/users/documents/'
modified_path = checkManagerTag(Path(file_path), manager_path)
print(modified_path)
```

*Expected Output*: `'J:\/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/file.txt'`

This example shows that the function correctly identifies the relationship between the file path and the manager path and converts the file path accordingly.

*Example 2: Handling Non-Relative Paths*

In this example, we pass a file path that is not relative to the manager path to observe the function's behavior in such cases.

```python
file_path = 'D:/projects/data/file.txt'
manager_path = 'C:/users/documents/'
modified_path = checkManagerTag(Path(file_path), manager_path)
print(modified_path)
```

*Expected Output*: `'D:\/projects/data/file.txt'`

When the file path is not relative to the manager path, the function should return the original file path without modification.

*Troubleshooting Tips:*

- Ensure that the paths provided to the function are valid and exist in the system.
- Verify that the manager path is correctly specified to avoid incorrect path conversions.

By following these examples and guidelines, users can effectively utilize and understand the `checkManagerTag` function in the Python code provided.
### Function: loadJsonFromText

#### Introduction:
The `loadJsonFromText` function is designed to extract and load a JSON object from a provided text string. This functionality is useful when dealing with text inputs that contain JSON data embedded within them.

#### Key Features and Functionalities:
1. Extraction of JSON object from text.
2. Conversion of extracted JSON object to Python dictionary.
3. Error handling for cases where a valid JSON object cannot be found in the text.

#### Example 1: Extracting and Loading a Simple JSON Object
```python
text = "This is some random text {\"key\": \"value\"} more random text"
success, json_data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)

if success:
    print(json_data)  # Output: {'key': 'value'}
else:
    print("No JSON object found in the text.")
```
**Expected Output:** The extracted JSON object `{ 'key': 'value' }` should be printed.

#### Example 2: Handling Incorrect JSON Object Format
```python
text = "This is a sample text without proper JSON object structure."
success, json_data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)

if success:
    print(json_data)
else:
    print("No JSON object found in the text.")
```
**Expected Output:** The message "No JSON object found in the text." should be displayed as the input text does not contain a valid JSON object.

#### Example 3: Extracting JSON Object from Complex Text
```python
text = "Some text {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": [1, 2, 3], \"key3\": {\"nested\": \"data\"}} some more text"
success, json_data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)

if success:
    print(json_data)
else:
    print("No JSON object found in the text.")
```
**Expected Output:** The extracted complex JSON object should be printed in dictionary format.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Make sure the input text contains a valid JSON object for successful extraction.
- Check for any syntax errors in the input text that might hinder JSON extraction.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the `loadJsonFromText` function using the provided examples and tailor it to suit your specific JSON extraction needs. Your feedback and suggestions for further improvements are welcome!
### Function: `stringToPathList`

#### Features:
- Parses a string to extract a list of file paths.
- Checks the existence of each path in the list.
- Returns a boolean indicating the overall existence status and the list of paths.

#### Use Cases:
1. Parsing a string and checking the existence of file paths.

#### Example 1: Simple Usage
```python
text = "['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt']"
success, paths = Loader.stringToPathList(text)
print(success)  # Expected output: True
print(paths)    # Expected output: ['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt']
```

#### Example 2: Handling Nonexistent Path
```python
text = "['/invalid/path1', '/valid/path2']"
success, paths = Loader.stringToPathList(text)
print(success)  # Expected output: False
print(paths)    # Expected output: ['/invalid/path1', '/valid/path2']
```

#### Example 3: Check and Retrieve Valid Paths
```python
text = "['/existing/path1/file1.jpg', '/existing/path2/file2.jpg']"
success, paths = Loader.stringToPathList(text)
if success:
    for path in paths:
        print(f"Path '{path}' exists.")
else:
    print("One or more paths do not exist.")
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Path '/existing/path1/file1.jpg' exists.
Path '/existing/path2/file2.jpg' exists.
```
### Loader_class

#### Brief Description:
The `Loader_class` class in the file `loader.py` provides various utility methods for loading and handling file paths and JSON data in a user-friendly manner.

#### Parameters (`Args`):
No parameters are passed directly to the `Loader_class` class as it contains utility methods that can be called independently with relevant parameters.

#### Returns:
The `Loader_class` does not have any direct return value as it consists of utility methods for performing specific tasks.

#### Raises:
The `Loader_class` does not raise any exceptions within the class itself.

#### Examples:
Examples of using methods from the `Loader_class`:

1. Loading a JSON object from text:
   ```python
   text = "Some text {\"key\": \"value\"} more text"
   success, data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)
   if success:
       print(data)  # Output: {'key': 'value'}
   ```

2. Getting a file path from the system:
   ```python
   file_path = Loader.getFilePathFromSystem()
   print(file_path)  # Returns the selected file path
   ```

#### Notes or Warnings (Optional):
- The `Loader_class` should be imported appropriately in your Python script to access its utility methods.
- Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed for the methods to work correctly (e.g., `tkinter` for GUI operations).

#### Other Sections (Optional):
This class encapsulates multiple utility functions for managing file paths and JSON data, providing a convenient interface for various file-related operations.
### Function: checkManagerTag

**Brief Description:**  
This function is used to check if a given file path is relative to a specific manager path and adjust the file path accordingly.

**Parameters (Args):**  
- `path`: Path - The file path to be checked.
- `manager_path`: Str - The manager path against which the file path should be checked for relative positioning.

**Returns:**  
- `filename`: Str - The modified file path, adjusted based on its relation to the manager path.

**Raises:**  
- This function does not raise any specific exceptions.

**Examples:**  
```python
# Example 1
path = "C:/Users/MyDocuments/file.txt"
manager_path = "C:/Users/MyDocuments/Projects/Manager/"
output = checkManagerTag(path, manager_path)
# Output: "J:/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/file.txt"

# Example 2
path = "C:/Users/AnotherFolder/data.csv"
manager_path = "D:/Projects/Manager/"
output = checkManagerTag(path, manager_path)
# Output: "C:/Users/AnotherFolder/data.csv"
```

**Notes or Warnings:**  
- The function assumes that the `manager_path` is the parent directory against which the relative positioning is determined.
- If the file path is not relative to the `manager_path`, the original `path` is returned without any modification.

- **Brief Description:** This function extracts a JSON object from a given text string.

- **Parameters (`Args`):**
    - `text` (str): The text string that may contain a JSON object.

- **Returns:** Returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating success (True for successful extraction, False otherwise) and the extracted JSON object (if successful).

- **Raises:** This function does not raise any exceptions.

- **Examples:** 
    ```python
    text1 = "Some text {\"key\": \"value\"} here"
    success1, json_obj1 = loadJsonFromText(text1)
    print(success1)  # Output: True
    print(json_obj1)  # Output: {'key': 'value'}

    text2 = "No JSON object here"
    success2, json_obj2 = loadJsonFromText(text2)
    print(success2)  # Output: False
    print(json_obj2)  # Output: None
    ```

- **Notes or Warnings (Optional):** If the function fails to find a valid JSON object in the text, it will return `False` and `None` as the output. This function assumes that the JSON object is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

- **Other Sections (Optional):** N/A
### Function: `stringToPathList`

#### Brief Description:
This function takes a string containing comma-separated paths, checks if each path exists, and returns a list of paths if they all exist.

#### Parameters (`Args`):
- `text` (str): A string containing comma-separated paths to be checked.

#### Returns:
- (bool, list): A tuple containing a boolean value indicating if all paths exist (True) or not (False), and a list of paths.

#### Raises:
- None

#### Examples:
```python
# Example 1
text = "C:/Users/Documents, D:/Images, E:/Music"
exists, paths = Loader.stringToPathList(text)
print(exists)  # Output: True
print(paths)   # Output: ['C:/Users/Documents', 'D:/Images', 'E:/Music']

# Example 2
text = "C:/Program Files, D:/Videos/Movies"
exists, paths = Loader.stringToPathList(text)
print(exists)  # Output: False
print(paths)   # Output: ['C:/Program Files', 'D:/Videos/Movies']
```

#### Notes or Warnings:
- This function assumes that the paths are provided in a valid format and separated by commas.
- The function does not handle any path manipulation or conversion.

#### Other Sections:
- None
