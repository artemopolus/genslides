### `checkManagerTag` Function

**Features and Functionalities:**
1. Generates a tagged file path based on a manager path for file organization.
2. Handles different operating systems to ensure compatibility.
3. Allows for customization of the tag to differentiate between special files and folders.

**Use Case:**
This function is commonly used when managing files within a specific directory structure and need to reference them using a tagged path for identification and organization.

**Example 1: Basic Usage**
```python
manager_path = "C:/Users/Manager/"
path = "C:/Users/Manager/Documents/File.txt"

tagged_path = checkManagerTag(path, manager_path)
print(tagged_path)
```
**Expected Output:** `J:\/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/Documents/File.txt`

**Example 2: Handling Subfolders**
```python
manager_path = "./Manager/"
path = "./Manager/Project/Folder1/File.txt"

tagged_path = checkManagerTag(path, manager_path)
print(tagged_path)
```
**Expected Output:** `J:\/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/Project/Folder1/File.txt`

**Example 3: Specifying Special File Tag**
```python
manager_path = "../Data/"
path = "../Data/Images/Pic.jpg"

special_file_tag = "img"
tagged_path = checkManagerTag(path, manager_path, False, special_file_tag)
print(tagged_path)
```
**Expected Output:** `[[manager:path:img]]/Images/Pic.jpg`

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure that the provided paths are valid and existing directories or files.
- Double-check the manager path and adjust it if the tagged path is not being correctly generated.
- Verify the special file tags for consistency and clarity in file organization.

**Feedback:**
Is the `checkManagerTag` function clear in its purpose and implementation? Any suggestions for improving the examples or additional scenarios to cover? Your input is valuable for enhancing the usability of the function.
For the `convertFilePathToTag` function, we will demonstrate how it converts a file path to a tagged version based on a manager path. This function is particularly useful when you want to create a symbolic or tagged representation of a file path relative to a specific "manager" location in your file system.

Here is an example showcasing the usage of the `convertFilePathToTag` function:

```python
def convertFilePathToTag(file_path, manager_path):
    """
    Converts a file path to a tagged version based on the manager path.
    
    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The file path to be converted.
    - manager_path (str): The manager path used as a reference.

    Returns:
    - str: Tagged version of the file path relative to the manager path.
    """

    # Example Usage:
    file_path = "/Users/user/documents/file.txt"
    manager_path = "/Users/user/manager"

    tagged_path = convertFilePathToTag(file_path, manager_path)
    print(tagged_path)

# Expected Output:
# If the manager_path is "/Users/user/manager" and file_path is "/Users/user/documents/file.txt",
# the tagged_path should be "J:\/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/documents/file.txt"
```

This example demonstrates how the `convertFilePathToTag` function can be used to convert a file path to a tagged version relative to a specified manager path. The tagged path can help in referring to files based on a hierarchical structure defined by the manager path.

Users can modify the `file_path` and `manager_path` variables in the example to observe how the function generates the tagged path accordingly. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to reference files within a project or system in a symbolic manner, based on a designated manager path.
### Function: loadJsonFromText

#### Features and functionalities:
1. Extracts JSON objects from a string.
2. Parses the extracted JSON object and converts it into a Python dictionary format.
3. Handles cases where JSON objects are embedded within a larger text.

#### Simple Example:
```python
text = "This is some text {\"key\": \"value\"} and additional information"
success, data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)
if success:
    print(data)
else:
    print("No valid JSON object found in the text.")
```

#### Description:
This example demonstrates extracting a JSON object from a text string and converting it into a dictionary. If a valid JSON object is found, it prints the parsed data; otherwise, it displays a message indicating that no JSON object was found.

#### Expected Output:
```
{'key': 'value'}
```

#### Advanced Example:
```python
text = "Some text {\"key\": \"value\", \"nested\": {\"num\": 123, \"bool\": true}}"
success, data = Loader.loadJsonFromText(text)
if success:
    print(data)
else:
    print("No valid JSON object found in the text.")
```

#### Description:
This example showcases parsing a more complex JSON object with nested structures. It demonstrates the ability to handle nested JSON objects embedded within the text.

#### Expected Output:
```
{'key': 'value', 'nested': {'num': 123, 'bool': True}}
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure that the JSON object is properly formatted within the text.
- Validate that the text contains the specific JSON object you intend to extract.

#### Feedback:
Your feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of these examples is valuable. Feel free to suggest improvements or request additional examples for better understanding.
### `stringToPathList` Function

#### Primary Features:
- Converts a string containing paths to a list of paths.
- Validates the existence of each path in the list.

#### Use Cases:
1. Convert a string of paths to a list:
   - Input: `'['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']'`
   - Output: `['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']`

2. Validate paths in the list:
   - Input: `['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']`
   - Output: `(True, ['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop'])`

#### Example 1: Convert a Path String to a List
```python
path_string = "['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']"
path_list = Loader.stringToPathList(path_string)
print(path_list)
```
#### Expected Output:
```
['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']
```

#### Example 2: Validate Paths in the List
```python
path_list = ['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop']
is_valid, valid_paths = Loader.stringToPathList(path_list)
print(is_valid, valid_paths)
```
#### Expected Output:
```
(True, ['C:/Users/User/Documents', 'C:/Users/User/Desktop'])
```

#### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that the input string follows the correct format with paths enclosed in square brackets and single quotes.
- Check individual paths in the list for any formatting errors that may cause validation issues.

#### Feedback:
I have provided examples to showcase the functionality of the `stringToPathList` function. If you have any feedback or need further clarification, please let me know.
