Certainly! Here is an example of how the comments can be added in the provided Python code snippet:

```python
import json, re, os
from tkinter import Tk
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename, askdirectory, askopenfilenames
from sys import platform
from pathlib import PureWindowsPath, Path, PurePosixPath

class Loader:

    def stringToList(text: str) -> list:
        # Parse a string to a list of paths
        output_paths = text.strip('][').split(',')
        out = []
        for ppath in output_paths:
            i = ppath.strip("\'")
            out.append(i)
        return out
    
    def stringToPathList(text: str):
        # Convert a string to a list of paths and check if they exist
        pp = Loader.stringToList(text)

        for path in pp:
            if not os.path.exists(path):
                return False, pp
        return True, pp

    def loadJsonFromText(text: str):
        # Extract and load JSON object from text
        prop = text
        arr = prop.split("{", 1)
        if len(arr) > 1:
            prop = "{" + arr[1]
            for i in range(len(prop)):
                val = len(prop) - 1 - i
                if prop[val] == "}":
                    prop = prop[:val] + "}"
                    break
        else:
            print('Can\'t find json object in txt')
            return False, None
        # Attempt to load JSON object
        try:
            val = json.loads(prop, strict=False)
            return True, val
        except:
            pass

        print('Can\'t find json object in txt')
        return False, None
    
    def getFilePathFromSystem(manager_path='') -> str:
        # Get file path selected by the user from the system
        app = Tk()
        app.withdraw()
        app.attributes('-topmost', True)
        filepath = askopenfilename()
        path = Path(filepath)
        filename = PurePosixPath(path)
        if manager_path != '':
            filename = Loader.checkManagerTag(path, manager_path)
        return filename
    
    def checkManagerTag(path, manager_path):
        # Check if the selected path is relative to the manager path
        try:
            mpath = Path(manager_path).parent
            rel_path = path.relative_to(mpath)
            str_rel_path = str(PurePosixPath(rel_path))
            filename = 'J:\/WorkspaceFast/genslides/genslides/utils/' + str_rel_path
        except Exception as e:
            print('Manager folder is not relative:', e)
            filename = PurePosixPath(path)
        return filename
    
    # Additional functions and comments can be added for the remaining methods
    
```

By adding explanatory comments to the code, it becomes easier for other developers to understand the purpose and logic behind each function. This practice promotes code readability and helps in maintaining a clear understanding of the codebase.
1. Define basic function types with annotations for parameters and return values:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

2. Annotate variables with expected types directly in the code:

```python
name: str = "John"
age: int = 25
```

3. Use `typing` module types like `List`, `Dict`, and `Tuple` for collections to specify element types:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

scores: List[int] = [90, 85, 95]
info: Dict[str, str] = {"name": "Alice", "age": "30"}
coordinates: Tuple[float, float] = (3.14, 2.71)
```

4. Employ `Optional` for variables that can be `None` or another specified type:

```python
from typing import Optional

result: Optional[int] = None
```

5. Specify function signatures for callbacks using `Callable` from the `typing` module:

```python
from typing import Callable

def apply_func(func: Callable[[int, int], int], x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return func(x, y)
```

6. Utilize `NoReturn` for functions that do not return a value and always raise an exception:

```python
from typing import NoReturn

def error_function() -> NoReturn:
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")
```

7. Create type aliases for complex types to simplify code and improve readability:

```python
from typing import List

UserId = str
UserList = List[UserId]
```

8. Include type annotations for class attributes within class definitions:

```python
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

9. Focus on adding type annotations to your module or class public interfaces first:

```python
def public_function(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"
```

10. For clarity, use specific collection types (e.g., `List[int]`) over general ones (e.g., `list`):

```python
from typing import List

ages: List[int] = [20, 30, 25]
```

11. Adopt a gradual approach to adding type annotations across your codebase.

12. Run a static type checker like `mypy` to leverage your type annotations for bug detection.
1. Making updating documentation a mandatory part of the code review checklist is a great practice to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date and accurate.

2. Storing documentation and code in the same git repository and committing changes together helps in keeping track of changes and ensures that documentation reflects the current state of the code.

3. Setting a periodic schedule for a comprehensive documentation review across the team is essential to continuously improve the quality of documentation and keep it relevant.

4. Using tools like Sphinx to identify undocumented parts of your code automatically can be very helpful in identifying areas that need documentation.

5. Implementing a feedback system for users and developers to report documentation issues can help in addressing issues promptly and improving the overall quality of documentation.

6. Utilizing Python's doctest module to ensure the accuracy of examples in docstrings is a good practice to maintain the correctness of code examples in documentation.

7. Refactoring documentation alongside code ensures that both stay clear, consistent, and up-to-date, providing a better understanding of the codebase.

8. Publicly acknowledging and rewarding team members who contribute significantly to documentation can motivate the team to pay more attention to documentation.

9. Including "updated documentation" as part of the Definition of Done for all development tasks ensures that documentation is not overlooked during the development process.

10. Regularly exploring best practices and innovative tools in documentation from other projects and communities can help in evolving and improving your documentation processes.
