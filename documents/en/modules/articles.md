### Automating Research Analysis with LLMs: A Collaborative Approach

Imagine this problem: you need to find specific information within research articles. Automating the analysis of a large number of articles for efficient information retrieval is a pressing challenge in modern science. For example, you might need a review of existing technologies or to find similar research approaches.

Traditional manual analysis of articles, although it yields consistent results, is extremely labor-intensive and slow, especially when working with large datasets. Moreover, while manual analysis is ongoing, new publications emerge, making the sample incomplete and potentially irrelevant. This is where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be useful, and their applications are already being actively discussed, albeit often in a negative light: the replacement of actual human work with LLM-generated *content*.

I want to propose what I believe is a more constructive approach: writing research in a specific field *with the help* of LLMs. The process is pretty straightforward:

1. **Define the Research Summary:** First, we write a clear research summary (like an abstract) that defines what we're looking for and shapes the final outcome. A well-written summary focuses our search and information analysis.

2. **Automated Article Search:** Next, we find articles on the topic. LLMs can help here, too. They can search for relevant articles based on our research summary, automating part of the research process.

3. **Chunk and Analyze:** We break each article into smaller chunks. Then, a computer program (an algorithm) processes each chunk. Each chunk is compared to our research summary based on specific criteriaâ€”like topic, semantic proximity (similarity in meaning), or the presence of specific keywords.  This gives each chunk a set of scores based on how well it matches our research summary.

4. **Article Scoring:** These individual chunk scores are then combined into an overall score, showing how relevant the entire article is.

5. **Aggregate Results:** Finally, we combine all these overall article scores.

This automated approach saves time and resources for both researchers and reviewers. LLMs provide relative objectivity and transparency in assessing the relevance of the research. Furthermore, this approach opens up prospects for creating self-updating articles that automatically integrate new research results.
